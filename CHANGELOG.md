## [2.6.0] - 2026-01-19

### 🧠 Compaction-Resilient Memory System (Major Feature)

This release introduces a **three-tier memory system** that survives context compaction, ensuring Claude never loses critical project knowledge during long sessions.

### 🔄 Ralph Loop PRD Support (Major Feature)

Implements structured task tracking inspired by the original [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) project. This brings PRD-based task management to ralph-loop, enabling reliable completion tracking across iterations.

### Added

- **Notepad Memory System** (`src/hooks/notepad/index.ts`) - **Compaction-Resilient Context**
  - `.sisyphus/notepad.md` persists across context compactions
  - **Three-tier storage architecture:**
    - **Priority Context** - Always loaded on session start (max 500 chars, critical discoveries)
    - **Working Memory** - Session notes with timestamps (auto-pruned after 7 days)
    - **MANUAL** - User content that is never auto-pruned
  - **Auto-injection** of Priority Context via SessionStart hook
  - **Auto-pruning** of old Working Memory entries on session stop
  - `/note <content>` command for manual note-taking

- **Remember Tag Auto-Capture** (`src/installer/hooks.ts`) - **PostToolUse Hook**
  - `<remember>content</remember>` - Auto-saves to Working Memory section
  - `<remember priority>content</remember>` - Auto-saves to Priority Context section
  - Agents can output remember tags to persist discoveries across compactions
  - Works without jq dependency (grep/sed fallback)
  - Installed as `post-tool-use.sh` hook

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document) Support** (`src/hooks/ralph-prd/index.ts`)
  - `prd.json` structured task format with user stories, acceptance criteria, priorities
  - Story status tracking (`passes: boolean`) for completion detection
  - CRUD operations: `readPrd`, `writePrd`, `markStoryComplete`, `getNextStory`
  - Status calculation: `getPrdStatus` returns completion stats

  - `/ralph-init <task>` - Scaffold a PRD from task description with auto-generated user stories
  - `/ultrawork-ralph <task>` - Maximum intensity mode with completion guarantee (ultrawork + ralph loop)
  - `/ultraqa <goal>` - Autonomous QA cycling workflow (test → verify → fix → repeat)
  - `/sisyphus-default` - Configure Sisyphus in local project `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - `/sisyphus-default-global` - Configure Sisyphus globally in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  - `/note <content>` - Save notes to notepad.md for compaction resilience

- **New Agent Tiers**
  - `qa-tester-high` (Opus) - Complex integration testing

  - Total: **358 tests** (up from 231)

### Changed

- **Ralph Loop Enhanced**
  - Auto-initializes PRD when user runs `/ralph-loop` without existing `prd.json`
  - PRD-based completion: loop ends when ALL stories have `passes: true`
  - Context injection includes current story, patterns, and recent learnings
  - Updated continuation prompts with structured story information

- **Persistent Mode Integration**
  - `src/hooks/persistent-mode/index.ts` now imports and uses PRD completion checking

  - Interactive CLI testing using tmux sessions
  - Prerequisite checking (tmux availability, server connections)
  - Structured test execution workflow
  - Oracle → QA-Tester diagnostic loop pattern

- **Smart Gating for qa-tester** in ultrawork/skills

  - Use qa-tester only when interactive testing is truly needed
  - Token-efficient verification decisions

- **Adaptive Routing for qa-tester**
  - Simple verification → Haiku
  - Interactive testing → Sonnet
  - Complex integration → Opus

### Changed
- Updated ultrawork skill with verification protocol and qa-tester gating
- Updated ralph-loop and orchestrator with qa-tester integration
- Updated sisyphus command with Agent Combinations section

### Refactored
- **Merged sisyphus+orchestrator+ultrawork into default mode** - 80% behavior overlap consolidated

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Revolutionary: Intelligent Model Routing

**This is a major release introducing adaptive model routing for all agents.**

The orchestrator (Opus) now analyzes task complexity BEFORE delegation and routes to the appropriate model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). This dramatically improves efficiency - simple tasks use faster, cheaper models while complex tasks get the full power of Opus.

### Added
- **Intelligent Model Routing System** (`src/features/model-routing/`)
  - `types.ts`: Core types for routing (ComplexityTier, RoutingDecision, etc.)
  - `signals.ts`: Complexity signal extraction (lexical, structural, context)
  - `scorer.ts`: Weighted scoring system for complexity calculation
  - `rules.ts`: Priority-based routing rules engine
  - `router.ts`: Main routing logic with `getModelForTask()` API
  - `prompts/`: Tier-specific prompt adaptations (opus.ts, sonnet.ts, haiku.ts)

- **Adaptive Routing for ALL Agents**
  - Only orchestrators are fixed to Opus (they analyze and delegate)
  - All other agents adapt based on task complexity:
    - `oracle`: lookup → Haiku, tracing → Sonnet, debugging → Opus
    - `prometheus`: breakdown → Haiku, planning → Sonnet, strategic → Opus
    - `momus`: checklist → Haiku, gap analysis → Sonnet, adversarial → Opus
    - `metis`: impact → Haiku, deps → Sonnet, risk analysis → Opus
    - `explore`: simple search → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `document-writer`: simple docs → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `sisyphus-junior`: simple fix → Haiku, module work → Sonnet, risky → Opus

- **Complexity Signal Detection**
  - Lexical: word count, keywords (architecture, debugging, risk, simple)
  - Structural: subtask count, cross-file deps, impact scope, reversibility
  - Context: previous failures, conversation depth, plan complexity

- **Tiered Prompt Adaptations**
  - Haiku: Concise, direct prompts for speed
  - Sonnet: Balanced prompts for efficiency
  - Opus: Deep reasoning prompts with thinking mode

### Changed
- **Orchestrator Prompts** updated with intelligent routing guidance
- **Configuration** (`src/config/loader.ts`) now includes routing options
- **Types** (`src/shared/types.ts`) extended with routing configuration

### Breaking Changes
- Routing is now proactive (orchestrator decides upfront) instead of reactive
- Deprecated `routeWithEscalation()` - use `getModelForTask()` instead

### Migration Guide
No action needed - the system automatically routes based on complexity. To override:
```typescript
Task(subagent_type="oracle", model="opus", prompt="Force Opus for this task")
```

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Enhanced Hook Enforcement System** - Stronger Sisyphus behavior enforcement beyond CLAUDE.md
  - `pre-tool-enforcer.sh`: PreToolUse hook that injects contextual Sisyphus reminders before every tool execution
  - `post-tool-verifier.sh`: PostToolUse hook for verification after tools, with failure detection
  - Enhanced `persistent-mode.sh`: Stop hook now includes build/test/git/background task verification
  - `claude-sisyphus.sh`: CLI wrapper that uses `--append-system-prompt` for direct system prompt injection
  - `sisyphus-aliases.sh`: Shell aliases (`claude-s`, `claudew`) for easy activation

### Changed
- **Stop Hook** now enforces additional verification requirements:
  - Build verification (if build scripts exist)
  - Test verification (if tests exist)
  - Git status check (warns on uncommitted changes)
  - Background task completion check
  - All previous checks (Ralph Loop, Ultrawork, Todo completion)

- **Hook Configuration** - Added PreToolUse and PostToolUse to `hooks.json`

### Technical Details
- PreToolUse hook provides tool-specific reminders (Bash, Task, Edit, Write, Read, Grep/Glob)
- PostToolUse hook tracks session statistics in `~/.claude/.session-stats.json`
- Stop hook returns `continue: false` until ALL verification requirements are met
- CLI wrapper appends core Sisyphus rules directly to Claude's system prompt

### Enforcement Hierarchy
1. **Stop Hook** with `continue: false` - Blocks ALL stopping until verified
2. **PreToolUse** - Injects reminders BEFORE every tool
3. **PostToolUse** - Verifies AFTER every tool
4. **CLI Wrapper** - Appends rules to system prompt

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Persistent Mode System** - Enhanced hook system for auto-continuation
  - `ultrawork-state` module: Manages persistent ultrawork mode state across sessions
  - `persistent-mode` hook: Unified Stop handler for ultrawork, ralph-loop, and todo continuation
  - `session-start` hook: Restores persistent mode states when a new session starts
  - Three-layer priority enforcement: Ralph Loop > Ultrawork > Todo Continuation

- **Claude Code Native Hooks Integration**
  - SessionStart hook for mode restoration on session resume
  - Enhanced Stop hook with persistent mode detection
  - Cross-platform support (Bash for Unix, Node.js for Windows)

- **Popular Plugin Patterns Module** (`plugin-patterns`)
  - Auto-format support for multiple languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
  - Lint validation with language-specific linters
  - Conventional commit message validation
  - TypeScript type checking integration
  - Test runner detection and execution
  - Pre-commit validation workflow

### Changed
- **Bridge Module** - Added persistent-mode and session-start hook handlers
- **Keyword Detector** - Now activates ultrawork state when ultrawork keyword is detected
- **Settings Configuration** - Added SessionStart hook configuration for both Bash and Node.js

### Technical Details
- New hooks: `persistent-mode.sh/.mjs`, `session-start.sh/.mjs`
- State files: `.sisyphus/ultrawork-state.json`, `~/.claude/ultrawork-state.json`
- Ultrawork mode now persists across stop attempts when todos remain incomplete
- Ralph-loop continues with iteration tracking and reinforcement messages

  - Fixed agent path for prometheus from `'prometheus/skill.md'` to `'prometheus.md'`
  - Added directory creation for both commands and skills to prevent ENOENT errors
  - Fixed ultrawork skill to remove JavaScript wrapper code (clean prompt only)

- **Template escaping**
  - Properly escaped backticks, template literals (`${}`), and backslashes in all skill templates
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors due to improper template string escaping

- **SDK adaptation**
  - Converted all oh-my-opencode SDK patterns to Claude Code SDK:
    - `sisyphus_task()` → `Task(subagent_type=...)`
    - `background_output()` → `TaskOutput()`
    - References to OhMyOpenCode → Oh-My-ClaudeCode-Sisyphus

### Verified
- All 6 builtin skills install correctly to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Orchestrator skill properly delegates with `Task(subagent_type=...)`
- Ultrawork skill contains clean verification guarantees and zero-tolerance failures
- Build completes without TypeScript errors
