# hooks/

## Purpose

Runtime hook configuration file (`hooks.json`) that Claude Code reads to register event handlers. This is the compiled/installed output — the hook scripts themselves are generated during installation from templates in `templates/hooks/` and source in `src/hooks/`. The scripts referenced here are installed to the user's `~/.claude/` directory.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hooks.json` | Hook event registration — maps Claude Code hook events to handler scripts |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory

- `hooks.json` is the authoritative hook configuration for this repository
- Hook scripts (`.mjs`, `.cjs`) are located in `scripts/` not here
- Do not edit `hooks.json` manually — it is generated by the installation system (`src/installer/`)
- The source for hook logic lives in `src/hooks/<hook-name>/`

### Hook Event Types

Claude Code fires these events that OMC handles:
- `PreToolUse` — before a tool runs (can inject context or block)
- `PostToolUse` — after a tool runs (can verify results)
- `UserPromptSubmit` — when user submits a prompt
- `SessionStart` — when a new session begins
- `SessionEnd` — when a session ends
- `Stop` — when Claude stops generating

## Dependencies

### Internal
- Hook scripts referenced here live in `scripts/`
- Hook source code lives in `src/hooks/`
- Installation generates this from `src/installer/hooks.ts`
